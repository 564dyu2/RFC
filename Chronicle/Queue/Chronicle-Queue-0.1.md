# Goals
An RFC for platform specific requirements for Chronicle Queue solutions.

## Description
A Chronicle Queue is an implementation of a persistent queue. This queue is only appended and entries are not removed.
This Queue can also be thought of as a Journal.

## Related RFCs
The file format uses;

 - [Size Prefixed Blobs](https://github.com/OpenHFT/RFC/blob/master/Size-Prefixed-Blob/) for the overall file structure
 - [Wire Format API](https://github.com/OpenHFT/RFC/blob/master/Wire-Format-API/) for individual messages and meta data

# Meta data wire messages.
All messages added for the implementation of the queue will be marked as "meta-data". All user provided messages will be marked as "data".
A reader which needs to scan all the user messages can do so by skipping all the meta data messages.

## The header message
The first message will be the header.  This header has the following structure in Text Wire format.
```
header: {

}
```
## The index2index message
The second message will be the index2index message.
This message has a primary level lookup to support random access of entries in the queue.
This message contains the byte offset index of "index" message in the queue.

## The index message
The index message contains the offset of every N messages.  N is likely to be a power of two. e.g. 64.

To perform a random lookup of a message,
 - look at the "header" to find the "index2index" message
 - look in the "index2index" message to find the appropriate "index" message.
 - look in the "index" to find the start of a sequence of messages e.g. every 64th message.
 - scan along the sizes of each message to find the actual message.

The "header" and "index2index" message should be in cache after performing a random access.
This means there is at least non cached 2 page accesses to find a random message.
