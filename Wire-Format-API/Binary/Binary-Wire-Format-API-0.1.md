# Goals

A compact encoding that both desicrbes the the length of the fields and the type of the fields.

See example below

# First byte

For short fields, the first byte denotes the type of the field, for small numbers the value is encoded in the later 4 bits. For strings and fields the later 4 bits denote the length of the preceeding data. For large numerics or string/fields the special type is used see section below :

| top three bits denotes a three Type   | x   | x   | x   |  x  |     |     |     |    |
| remaining bits dontes the size/value  |     |     |     |     | x   | x  |  x   | x  |

## Types ( for larger values )

the types use the Control Messages

| Control message                       | 7   | 6   | 5   | 4   | 3   | 2   | 1   | 0  |

| (0x82) - Nested Block 32bit len 82    | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |  0 | 
| (0x8A) - byte[]                       | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |  0 |

| (0x8E) - paddding with 32bit length   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |  0 | 
| (0x8E) - single padded byte           | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   |  1 |
