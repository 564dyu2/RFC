# Goals

A compact encoding that both desicrbes the the length of the fields and the type of the fields.

See example below

# Encoding Byte

For short fields, the first byte denotes the type of the field, for small numbers the value is encoded in the later 4 bits. For strings and fields the later 4 bits denote the length of the preceeding data. For large numerics or string/fields the special type is used see section below :

| top three bits denotes a three Type   | x   | x   | x   |  x  |     |     |     |    |
| remaining bits denotes the size/value |     |     |     |     | x   | x  |  x   | x  |
