# Goals

A compact encoding that both desicrbes the the length of the fields and the type of the fields.

See example below

# First byte

For short fields, the first byte denotes the type of the field, for small numbers the value is encoded in the later 4 bits. For strings and fields the later 4 bits denote the length of the preceeding data.
