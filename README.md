RFC's used by OpenHFT

This repo holds the specifications which are to be used by OpenHFT projects.  

Each Specification is held in a directory which has a file for each version. Each specification will have a short code awuth the first version being 0.1.  
It is prompted to version 1.0 when released followed by 1.1 for minor enhancements and 2.0 for major enhancements.  
Each standard must be backward compatible with previous versions.  For a breaking change, start a new specification.

A version can be created or added by forking the repo and issuing a pull request for the changes made.
